    <h1>Welcome to the Kudu Star site!</h1>
    <p>My name is Yves Laingui and I am a Cloud Engineer </p>
    <p>This website is to showcase my CV as a project </p>
    <p>The outcome is to publish some of my personal details, create a visitor counter and showcase that the counter actually works </p>
    <p>Ideally I will be using resources in Azure and Github Terraform to create a website and deploy it to the cloud </p>
