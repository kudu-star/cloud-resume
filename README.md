Project Scope

Overview
The cloud-resume project aims to create a basic website that includes a visitor counter. 
The counter will be implemented using a database and will update in real-time. 
The website will be hosted in the cloud and built using a CI/CD pipeline. 
The infrastructure will be defined using Infrastructure as Code and 
The website will be built using a serverless architecture.

Goals
- Create a basic website that includes a visitor counter
- Implement the visitor counter using a database
- Ensure the visitor counter updates in real-time
- Host the website in the cloud
- Build the website using a CI/CD pipeline
- Define the infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
- Build the website using a serverless architecture

Deliverables
- A fully functional website that includes a visitor counter
- A database that stores the visitor count and updates in real-time
- A cloud-hosted website that is accessible to users
- A CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys the website
- Infrastructure as Code that defines the website's architecture
- A serverless architecture that minimizes costs and maximizes scalability
